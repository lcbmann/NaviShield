# 🔐 **PhishSpotter**

**PhishSpotter** is an advanced AI-powered phishing detection system that leverages state-of-the-art transformer models (DistilBERT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and prevent phishing attacks in real-time. It analyzes web pages, emails, and online content instantly, highlighting suspicious linguistic patterns, URL anomalies, and structural indicators of phishing. The transformer model has been custom-trained on large publicly available datasets on common phishing URLs and messages.

## ✨ **Features**

- **Real-time Detection**: Instant analysis of URLs, emails, and website content.
- **Transformer-Based Analysis:** Utilizes DistilBERT for high-accuracy detection.
- **Interactive Interface:** User-friendly web UI and browser extension support.
- **Detailed Explanations:** Clearly highlights why content is flagged.
- **Open Source:** Transparent and privacy-friendly implementation.

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks & Tools:** TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, Flask/FastAPI
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages, optional deployment via Docker & Cloud platforms

## 🚀 **How It Works**
1. **Input Analysis:** Users input URLs, emails, or text content.
2. **Text Processing:** Content is tokenized, preprocessed, and vectorized.
3. **DistilBERT Prediction:** Transformer model evaluates the likelihood of phishing.
4. **Risk Assessment:** Outputs a detailed score and visual indicators.
