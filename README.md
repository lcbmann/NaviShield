Here’s an updated and **clarified README.md** that emphasizes **PhishSpotter** is focused on **manual URL detection** (for now) and avoids overpromising on email scanning or automation:

# 🔐 **PhishSpotter**

**PhishSpotter** is an AI-powered phishing **URL detection system** that uses transformer models (BERT-based) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assess whether a given URL is potentially malicious. The system has been trained on real phishing and benign URLs, offering a simple way to analyze URLs for security risks — directly through a **web interface or browser extension**.  

⚠️ **Note:** At this stage, PhishSpotter focuses **only on URL classification** (e.g., Phishing, Malware, Defacement, Benign). Full webpage content analysis, email scanning, and automation are **planned future features** but are **not yet implemented**.

---

## ✨ **Features**

- ✅ **Real-time URL Detection**: Check URLs instantly for malicious patterns.
- 🚀 **Transformer-Based Model**: Leverages a fine-tuned BERT model trained on a large dataset of malicious and safe URLs.
- 🌐 **Web Interface & Browser Extension**: Simple, user-friendly tools for manual URL checking.
- 📊 **Multi-Class Output**: Classifies URLs into **Benign, Phishing, Malware, Defacement**.
- 💡 **Open Source**: Fully transparent implementation — easy to audit and extend.

---

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Flask, Hugging Face Transformers (BERT), REST API
- **Deployment:** Render.com (backend), Chrome Extension (frontend)

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

1. **User Input:** Users submit a URL via the web app or browser extension.
2. **Tokenization & Processing:** The URL is formatted and analyzed via a Hugging Face-hosted transformer model.
3. **Classification:** The system classifies the URL into one of four categories:
   - **Benign** (Safe)
   - **Phishing**
   - **Malware**
   - **Defacement**
4. **Result Display:** The result and confidence score are returned to the user.


## 📚 **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Flask (API backend)
- Hugging Face Transformers (BERT-based model)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend web UI & extension)
