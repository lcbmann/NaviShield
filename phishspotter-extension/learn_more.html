  <h1>About PhishSpotter</h1>
  <p>PhishSpotter uses a combination of AI-based phishing detection and Google Safe Browsing to help you determine if a URL is safe or potentially harmful.</p>
  <h2>How it Works:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>URL Normalization:</strong> The URL is standardized to ensure consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Safe Browsing Check:</strong> The URL is first checked against Google's Safe Browsing API.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Analysis:</strong> If the URL passes Safe Browsing, it is then analyzed using an AI model.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Result:</strong> Based on the results from both checks, the extension reports the URL as "Safe," "Phishing," or "Uncertain."</li>
  </ol>
